# Disl Language Highlighter

Disl is language developed at Toki Labs for briefly describing a domain.
The name is an acronym for Domain Interaction Specification Language.

After specifying the domain in a `.disl` file, the Disl CLI parses it and can generate
a project or simply return an object representing the domain.

The language parser and generator are **private** and will be sold to the highest bidder at the end of 2018.
